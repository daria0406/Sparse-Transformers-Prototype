# Modular Sparse Transformers - Demonstration Report

This report summarizes the key findings from the sparse transformer research prototype demonstrations.

## Project Overview

This prototype implements and demonstrates three core areas of sparse transformer research:

1. **Sparse Attention Mechanisms** - Reducing computational complexity through selective attention patterns
2. **Expert Module Routing** - Mixture-of-experts systems for specialized processing  
3. **Truthfulness Evaluation** - Comprehensive metrics for fact-checking applications

## Attention Pattern Analysis

### Implemented Patterns

- **Dense Attention**: Standard full attention (baseline) - 0% sparsity, 1.0x speedup
